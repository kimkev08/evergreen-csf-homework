Homework 5: Election prediction


Collaboration:

in this lab i tried to work on the first questions by myuself but ended up getting guidence from cliff again.
after that i worked on the rest by myself

Reflection:

this lab was really hard for me and i feel frustrated that i couldnt even get passed the secound question by my self
even. i tried my best and thats what i think is what mattered, and by myself i learned a lot more by messing around 
with it then i would have if i just watched someone working on it till they got the answer. so i have mixed feelings
about this homework assaighment.
