Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

what happened was that the command gave me back an error because linenum was
undefined.if gc_count was comented out then another error would appear because
gc_count is needed to be defined to actually run the program.


Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.568993851852

Collaboration:

i worked with Cliff Randolph

Reflection:

what did i learn: more about dna i guess. also some things about functions like
you have to pay clos atention to them with the semicolon at the end and what not

what did i wish i already learned: the up on teminal can input previouse comands

what did i wish i did diffrently: i wished i didnt do the first seven questions
for the online class when i was only supposed to do 4 and that i didnt mess up
to badly on one of them.

future advice for students: if you meet a guy named Cliff listen to him
